						<p>I had my first internship at Spotify, working in the Car Thing Operations team. When joining the team, they were weeks away from launching Spotify’s first ever hardware product: CarThing, a music player for the car. During my internship I mainly worked with designing a My order Page for the webshop, where the users could review and track their order. Aside from this, I had a few side projects including evaluating   and giving suggestions for improvement to the existing page and the mobile version of it.   
						</p>
						<h4>My order project</h4>
						<h5>Tools used: Figma, Miro, Jira, Google sheets, Google slides, Trello</h5>
						<p>Together with another intern in the team, I was asked to bring a suggestion on how Spotify could own the communication with the user, from placing the order to delivery of the product. To do this, we started off by doing some research involving social and environmental analysis as well as benchmarking. We then proceeded to map out our insights using thematic analysis, followed by a roadmap containing features in a MVP and a complete version. With the roadmap in mind, we formulated user stories based of the different features of the page and created low fidelity prototypes of the MVP and complete version. After facilitating several workshops and design reviews with the team throughout the course of the project, we finalized our design by creating high fidelity prototypes in Figma which ended up being implemented on the website.</p>

						<p>Litium is a company which provides cloudbased e-commerce platforms B2B & B2C. They operate through a partner network which means that their clients go through web agencies when using Litiums product. For this project, we didn’t have any specific framework or directions to take into account, they simply had one goal: to get a better understanding of their customers and to create a closer relationship with them. To achieve this, we needed to start off with some exploratory research to clarify more specifically what problem they needed to be solved.</p> 
						<p>After numerous workshops and brainstorming ideas we ended up with our top five potential solutions. Discussing these through and voting eventually  narrowed it down to one: LitiRoom, a user forum with focus on onboarding, follow up and feedback where the customers can:</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Start threads to discuss or ask questions directly to Litium or other users.</li> 
							<li>Search for threads with similar content. </li> 
							<li>Get the opportunity to give feedback and suggestions</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Based on this, we created a simple desktop LitiRoom Lo-fi prototype in Figma, focusing on some main features that we thought best would meet the users needs.  This user flow is based on a scenario where the user wants to find information about the newest Litium upgrade</p>

						<p>Aftonbladet is one of the largest daily newspapers in sweden. For this assignment we were challenged to come up with an concept for how to attract generation Z to their news site. What do they want? How do they consume news today? These we’re a few questions we needed to answer in order to come up with a concept. After having conducted and transcribed several interviews, we analysed the answers to find common themes and draw insights. With these insights in mind we created Aftonbladet Recap - an accessible and effective news experience designed to appeal to younger audiences (pictured above). It was tailored to the target groups needs of a service where they quickly can get a summary of current events - which also gives them the possibility to immerse themselves in news they find interesting.
							The landing page presents the reader with clear titles and summaries of articles. It presents news in a format which the audience already consumes information in and is used to navigate through. If one wishes to read the entire article that can be done by clicking on the post. Our main features for the app were:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To give the reader a possibility to look over article titles with a grid or list view</li> 
							<li>To increase the credibility by including a visible source reference in the overview</li> 
							<li>The possibility to keep up with specific events, movements, or subjects the user finds interesting by marking these as favorites.</li>

						<h5>Methods used in this project: Heuristic evaluation, Social and environmental analysis, prototyping</h5>
						<p>In this project, our assignment was to formulate a case and design an app based on that. This included creating a clickable prototype to showcase how the app would look and function.  Since we knew our internship at Spotify was coming up (involving a project that had to do with playing music in the car) we decided to center the project around this.
							<br><br> We created two prototypes that aim to create a simpler, more limited view in the Spotify app (pictured above). The first prototype focuses on further developing the existing car view to be more accessible. It is currently a function that is switched on automatically when you have activated it in your settings, and connect to bluetooth in the car. The first thought that struck us was that this function can not be used if you are not connected to the car via bluetooth in particular. Thus, this function does not include users who connect to the car radio using AUX or USB (or use another means of transport that requires minimal distraction). Therefore the first prototype aims to make the function available regardless of connection to bluetooth in the car.
							<br><br> Since there are other occasions when a more stripped-down and easily accessible view would be useful, we developed an alternative prototype that can facilitate use in more occasions than those when driving a car. Therefore, we devised the new concept "Simply Spotify", a function that has a simpler interface, and is intended to be used in different situations that require minimal distractions. We therefore selected a number of "moods" based on which music is suggested. The idea is that Simply Spotify is supported by an algorithm that not only takes into account which mood the user chooses, but also what type of music the user normally listens to and which songs are "heart marked" in the player. Combined with a player mode with few keystrokes and limited navigation, this aims to create accessible music experiences better adapted to the user's situation. We have chosen four areas where we believe this function could be useful - "focus and wind down", "on the move", "get productive" and "workout".
